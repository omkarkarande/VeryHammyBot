The first warm day of Spring
Breaking into your own place after realizing you locked yourself out
The Stone Age
When the music player’s shuffle reads your mind
Dogs with jobs
The sound of a golf ball falling into the cup
Getting a good locker in high school
Car dancing
When a deadline is extended unexpectedly
The smell of really, really clean air
Putting things in your shoe so you don’t forget them later
Getting cell phone service back after not having it for a while
The smell of the barbecue
Baby to baby love
People who look like their pets
The good kind of stomach butterflies
Saying thanks
Eating a free sample of something you have no intention of buying
When the bass kicks in
That guy who brings treats to work on Friday
Finding a chocolate egg way after Easter
Optimistic Weather Dressers
Taking your makeup off after wearing it for hours
When none of the peas fall off your fork on the way to your mouth
Inventing new words and phrases that only make sense to you
Putting a slice of lasagna on a plate and having it stay all together
Digging out your own little wading pool of sand when you’re at the beach
Drinking anything besides wine out of a wine glass
When you’re looking for a friend at the grocery store and then suddenly spot them at the end of an aisle after running all over the place
Cool moms
Kids helping their little brother or sister across the street
Having a staring contest with a baby
When the mug you’re warming up in the microwave stops with the handle pointing towards you
When everyone you’re eating with at the restaurant agrees you made the best choice
Being single
That bite with all the toppings in it
Sticking your foot in the door just before it closes
When someone calls just to say hi
When you hit that point in the book where you suddenly can’t stop reading
Your thinking place
3:00am conversations with your best friend
When babies grab at your face with their tiny hands
Throwing non-ball objects to people
Drying off in the sun after swimming
When you continue talking through the yawn and your friend actually understands you
Flying over mountains
Watching the Christmas episode of your favorite sitcom in the completely wrong month
When you finally get rid of the thing that’s been rolling around the trunk of your car forever
Furiously scratching a mosquito bite even though you know you shouldn’t
Peeling a hard boiled egg and getting a big chunk of shell all at once
When you find the spot on the dog that makes its leg go crazy
Seeing what comes out of the garden at your new place
When that white noise you didn’t know existed in the background suddenly stops
Using your keyless entry remote to find your car in a big parking lot
Warm sandals that have been sitting in the sun
When little kids give you their artwork
Drinking from the hose
Actually squeezing out the right amount of sunblock
Putting your ear on someone’s stomach and hearing all the gurgling
When it’s sunny and raining at the same time
Eating a taco without anything falling out
Airborne hugs
When the guy who borrowed your pen actually gives it back
When you’re walking next to a fence or railing and you stick your finger or a stick in there so it clangs over and over
When one of your paintings or tests makes it onto the fridge
Baby dreams
Cleaning all that gunk out of your mouse ball
Vacuuming up a spider web
When someone returns your wallet
The person lying down at the front of the sports team photo
Opening security doors without using your hands
When everything you’re cooking gets done at the same time
Pulling a shrimp out of its shell with your teeth without the tail breaking off
When you owe someone $10 and they owe someone else $10 and they just give $10 to the person you owe instead
Actually making the right amount of spaghetti
That secretary who actually runs things around here
Becoming friends with the other guy who doesn’t know anyone here
Chugging cold milk after chocolate cake
Accidental snorts
Burps that taste good
When insects are struggling to do something and you help them
The moment after the lightning and before the thunder
A la moding anything
That bend in the pipe under the sink
Making disgusting slurping noises while eating a juicy peach
Anything that gets you really, really sweaty
Hoods
That moment just before you fall asleep when you know you’re about to fall asleep
When your friends with kids don’t just talk about their kids
Splashing someone beside the pool with a cannonball
Hands-free-everything bathrooms
Sleep lines
Spotting your house from the airplane window
Gravy
Tripping and realizing no one saw you
Getting your ID checked when you’re way over the legal age

Doing your thing
When the score’s tied up near the end of the game

Getting away with putting three desserts on your plate
Finally unsubscribing from that annoying email you’ve been getting for months
The Echo Meal
Any restaurant where old ladies are doing the cooking
Gutsy city animals
Finally getting that guy who never dances to dance
